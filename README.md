# Trustify — Decentralized Reputation System on Stellar

> 🔥 **"A decentralized reputation system where users earn a trust score based on their actions, ensuring transparency and reliability using blockchain."**

Built on the **Stellar testnet** with **Soroban smart contracts**. Unlike platforms like Uber or Fiverr where ratings can be fake, this system ensures trust is built from **real, verifiable, on-chain actions**.

---

## 💡 The Problem

In current systems (freelancing, marketplaces, service apps):
- Ratings can be **fake or manipulated**
- Users create **multiple accounts** to inflate reputation
- Trust is controlled by a **central authority**
- There is **no universal reputation** across platforms

---

## ✅ The Solution

A blockchain-based trust score system where:
- Every user action is **recorded on-chain**
- Trust score is **calculated automatically** via smart contracts
- **No one can fake or modify** their reputation
- Users build credibility through **real actions, not claims**

---

## ⚡ How Trust Score is Calculated

| Action | Points |
|---|---|
| ✅ Task Completed | **+10 pts** |
| 💸 Successful Transaction | **+5 pts** |
| 🤝 Peer Endorsement Received | **+3 pts** |
| 👎 Negative Feedback | **-5 pts** |
| ⚠️ Missed Deadline | **-3 pts** |

**Trust Levels:**
- 🌱 **Newcomer** (0–19 pts)
- 📈 **Growing** (20–49 pts)
- ⭐ **Trusted** (50–99 pts)
- 🏆 **Elite** (100+ pts)

## 🔁 Next Phase Improvements (Based on User Feedback)

Based on collected user feedback, the following improvements are planned for the next development cycle:

### 1. 📊 Score Breakdown Transparency
**Feedback:** "Score system unclear — I don't know how my score changed."
**Improvement:** Added an in-app **Scoring Rulebook** showing exactly what each action is worth (+10 for tasks, +5 for transactions, etc.)
> [Improvement Commit](https://github.com/ggdeshmukh12107-droid/Stellar-DApp/commit/331d45e)

### 2. 🔍 Category-Specific Scores
**Feedback:** "Would love to see separate scores for different skills (Design, Dev, etc.)"
**Improvement:** Add `taskCategory` field to split trust scores by skill domain (Developer Trust, Design Trust, etc.)

### 3. 🔎 Filtering & Discovery
**Feedback:** "Need a way to search for highly-rated freelancers."
**Improvement:** Add search bar and filter panel: filter by trust level, task type, and score range.

### 4. ⚖️ Decentralized Dispute System
**Feedback:** "What if someone endorses a bad task?"
**Improvement:** Implement a Soroban arbitration function where disputed endorsements can be challenged via community vote.

### 5. 📱 Mobile Responsive Improvements
**Feedback:** "UI looks great on desktop, needs work on mobile."
**Improvement:** Full mobile-first CSS overhaul for small screen viewports.
